You can contribute by filing issues, bugs and PRs. You can also take a look at active issues and fix them.

### Code contribution

- Open issue regarding proposed change.

- Open PR against latest *development* branch. Add nice description in PR, done!

### Code contribution checklist

- New code addition/deletion should not break existing flow of a system.
- Before committing your code, run ./gradlew app:spotlessApply to automatically format your code.
